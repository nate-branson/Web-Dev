      About Me:
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am a Computer and Information Science major with a concetration of Software 
      Engineering at Messiah College.  I'm from Virginia Beach and current looking 
      for an internship in Northern Virginia, Pennsylvania, or New York City for the 
      Summer of 2020.  I love to learn and learn quickly.  I have a great desire to 
      be the best at what I do.  Teamwork is something I have much experience in, 
      and being the leader is something I have experience in as well though I'm 
      willing to let someone take the lead if it is the best fit.  I know I am only 
      a sophomore, but I belive I am a great candidate for any internship.  Knowing 
      my skillset, coding is how my mind works.  I am learning many languages and 
      cannot wait to learn more!

      NOTE: I am still working through HTML and CSS (currently on my own), so the
       website may not work well with smaller screen sizes.
